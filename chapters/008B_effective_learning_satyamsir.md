I would like to start this special chapter by mentioning an incident that occurred in Swami Ramtirtha's life which I have read in a magazine many years before.

## a short story

Once, Swami Ramtirth was travelling to another country to advertise the ideals of Vedas and Upanishads by a ship. He observed that every morning when he came to the deck of the ship after taking bath and completing other morning rituals, an old Japanese man used to be there busy studying and learning something from a book and a copy. He was so indulged in his learning that he didn't even notice him nearby. After some days, Swamiji was unable to hold on to his curiosity, so he went over and asked that old man, _"What are you doing mister?"_

The old man watched him with a smiling face and replied, _"I am learning the Chinese language."_ Swamiji then asked him, _"What is your age gentleman?"_
The old man replied, _"I never counted my age so seriously but I am sure that I have crossed ninety."_ As Swamiji knew that the Chinese language is a pictorial language and it takes almost five years for a normal young person to learn its scriptures. Swamiji asked him anxiously, _"You are learning Chinese at this age, then when will you use it?"_ The old man counter questioned Swamiji, _" How old are you?"_ Swamiji answered, _" I am about 36."_ Then the old man asked, " Are you Indian? " Swamiji answered "Yes. " The old person then told him in a firm voice,

> "This is the main cause of the miseries in India. A young person like you believes that there should be some fixed age for learning. He concluded that he keeps learning so that he would feel energized and his mind remains refreshed and active."

Swamiji mentioned this event in his daily diary as a great lesson of his life.
Now, I think there is no need to talk about the importance of constant learning. To know the whole concept of learning we should go through the basic concept, laws, types, Plateau and some practical tips to learn fast.

## meaning of learning

Before getting to the idea of laws of learning, types of learning, plateau and practical tips of fast learning in this chapter you should know about the meaning of learning, which I think could be better understood by the following three definitions:

1.  "Learning consists of doing something new, provided this something new is retained by the individual and reappears in his later activities." _By the studies of Woodworth and Marquis._

2.  “Learning is the relatively permanent change in a person’s knowledge or behaviour due to experience. This definition has three components: 1) the duration of the change is long-term rather than short-term; 2) the locus of the change is content and structure of knowledge in memory or the behaviour of the learner; 3) the cause of the change is the learner’s experience in the environment rather than fatigue, motivation, drugs, physical condition or physiologic intervention.”
    _From Learning in Encyclopedia of Educational Research, Richard E. Mayer_

3.  “We define learning as the transformative process of taking in information, that when internalized and mixed with what we have experienced changes, what we know and build on what we do. It’s based on input, process, and reflection. It is what changes us.” _From The New Social Learning by Tony Bingham and Marcia Conner_

Now, for a better adaptation of the learning process, one should know the laws of learning. The laws of learning are credited to Edward Thorndike, an American psychologist who formulated them after observing the learning process shown by lower species but fully applicable for us too. He proposed two types of laws of learning i.e. Primary Laws of Learning and Secondary Laws of Learning.

## three primary laws of learning

1. **Law of Readiness** It simply means, a person will learn something only when he is mentally ready to learn. So, you should prepare yourself physically as well as mentally before going to learn anything new.

2. **Law of Exercise** This law says, "when a modifiable connection is made frequently between a situation and a response, the strength of that connection increases, but when a modifiable connection is not made between a situation and a response over a period of time, the strength of that connection decreases."

   Thorndike explained it as _" other things being equal, exercise strengthens the bond between situation and response."_
   This law is usually categorized into (a) Law of Use and (b) Law of Disuse.

   You can also see the influence of this law when you go through the chapter on 'Exercise' in this book.

3. **Law of Effect** This law states that " if the effort in doing any work is enjoyable, positive and pleasant, an individual tries to learn that activity quickly and learns it fast too."
   This law is also known as the _Law of satisfaction and dissatisfaction_.

## secondary laws of learning

_Thorndike_ has proposed the following nine secondary laws of learning :

1. **Law of Primacy** It simply means that the first or primary impression is clear and easy to learn.

2. **Law of Recency** It means what we learn at last remains fresh in our minds.

3. **Law of Contiguity** It is also called the Law of Association. It means if new knowledge or skill is associated with what we have learned earlier, it helps us learn the new skill.

4. **Law of Multiple Responses** According to this law, when a learner takes up a new challenge he/she will approach it with multiple responses, in a quest to know which one is the solution.

5. **Law of Contrast** If a person has learned a skill properly, he/she can learn the opposite skill easily.

6. **Law of Similarity** This law states that it is easy to learn similar skills or activities. Like one who knows how to ride a bicycle, can easily learn to ride a scooter.

7. **Law of Intensity of Stimulus** This law states that a strong stimulus creates a strong response. Thus it promotes the learning process.

8. **Law of Association Shifting** This law states that a conditioned response may be shifted to a new stimulus as a new type of response.

9. **Law of Attitude** This law states that one person gives more attention to what interests him.

## what's the transfer of learning

If we use the knowledge of these laws of learning while learning new skills or topics, it will be beneficial for us. We can also use the power of 'Transfer of Learning' for effective learning. For this purpose first, we should know, "What is the transfer of learning?"

1. According to M L Bigge, "Transfer of learning occurs when a person's learning in one situation influences his/her learning and performance in other situations."

2. According to Alexander and Murphy, "The process of using knowledge or skills acquired in one context, in a new and varied context is called transfer of learning."

## factors affecting the transfer of learning

There are many kinds of Transfer of Learning which I have read during the studies of sports psychology but one can only use it positively by considering the following factors:

1. The learner should grasp the situation and methods of skill he/she is going to learn and should increase their efficiency to identify similarities and contrasts between the new skills and previous skills.
2. The ability to chunk the skills in small parts.
3. The level of intelligence to take the whole situation and the learning process in a sequence in our mind.
4. The most important thing is will power and desire of the learner to learn new things.

## plateau of learning

Now you should also know that sometimes our speed of learning any specific skill, which was rapid in the initial phase, slows down and eventually stops. In educational psychology, this situation is termed as 'Plateau'. To get rid of this Plateau one should consider the following things:

1. One should not make things boring by repeating the same process of learning daily. They should try new methods instead.
2. One should also consider their physical and mental limitations.
3. One should search out for new areas of interest according to the situations in life.
4. Train the mind to be alive and focused on later periods of life.
5. There should be a moderate challenge for a feeling of healthy competition in one's life.

## practical tips for faster learning

At last, if the end is well, all is well so here are some practical tips for fast learning.

1. Keep changing or keep modifying your learning methods.
2. Learn by doing instead of watching or observing.
3. Always be ready to teach what you have learned.
4. Spend time in practicing things which you find difficult to perform.
5. Test yourself frequently and take frequent breaks too.
6. Find a mentor and be curious about new things.

All the best to everyone for learning new and valuable things because it is rightly said, that learning is endless.
