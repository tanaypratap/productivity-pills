attention management

Once my elder son Nitya asked me a very important question according to his age, "Father, whenever I am studying, I am not able to keep all my focus on studies. If there is a little discussion at home or if there is some kind of voice, I get distracted easily and start to get angry at others. But a few days ago when I was watching a movie an accident happened near our home. Everyone ran and reached there including members of our family except me. During that time I did not even feel anything about that incident. Why did my attention not deteriorate at that time? "
I explained to him that there are three main reasons behind it:

1. You were doing your favourite work and doing it as you wish.
2. You were not only watching this movie but also listening. That is, more than one of your senses was engaged in that work.
3. Your imagination was also engaged in it, meaning that you were also contemplating what would happen in this movie. For this reason, a part of your subconscious mind was involved in it.

If someone applies these principles in their studies or any other work, then they can remain focused in the same way. You can also have the power to achieve this kind of focus through practice. Make a habit of staying focused on any one task for the first few minutes and then slowly increase the time.

## stadiums shout, mind filters the noise out

I have felt that when we used to play a match surrounded by the audience. During our jump for smashing or serving the ball, people used to shout out loud but generally, we never get distracted as a player. I think it is mainly because players practice day and night for this kind of situation. Sometimes even after small injury, we keep on playing and don't feel any pain. It is also due to our zeal, enthusiasm and focus on our game. I think a clear, achievable and worthy goal is the key to keep oneself attentive and focused towards the work in hand. (I have described it in our chapter SMART goals.)
After sharing a thought with you all which I think is appropriate to start this chapter, we proceed further.

So if we want to be successful in our lives we should practice being attentive towards our most important task. As we all know the concentrated ray of sun can burn a paper. It is all about the power of concentration. I will explain my view on the topic with a small incident of Mahabharata.

When Dronacharya the great teacher of his times was teaching archery to his students, he once asked them to shoot a bird on the tree by aiming its eye. He called them one by one and showing the bird, he asked them what they saw while aiming at the bird's eye. Everyone except Arjuna said that they saw the tree, the branches etc. with the eye of the Bird so everyone missed the target except Arjuna. Rest we all can learn a lesson by this incident that since Arjuna was able to concentrate on the bird's eye, he shot the target properly and efficiently.

## Krishna says

As I started this chapter with the incident of Mahabharata I would like to include in this chapter some selected verses of our great book of wisdom the Bhagavad Gita, which not only inspired me to improve my level of concentration but also gives me some fruitful methods to improve it. In chapter 06, verse 26 Lord Krishna said, "Yato-yato nischalati manaschanchalmasthiram. Tarasta to niyamyetdatasmanev vasham nayet." Which means, "whenever and wherever the restless and unsteady mind wonders one should bring it back and continually focus it on god or worthy goal." So, we can say that our mind has a general tendency to wander here and there but we can control it by practice over it. In Chapter 6 verse 6 Lord Krishna quoted, "For those who have conquered the mind, it is their friend. For those who fail to do so, the mind works as the enemy.

## tips for enhancing your concentration level

People who will search can easily find many tips to improve attention and concentration. Though it was very difficult to search for the top five, I am sharing here the five most useful and practically adopted tips for enhancing concentration and attention --

1. Work in a distraction-free environment in the initial level of concentration practice.
2. Take properly balanced food according to your age, sex, climate condition and nature of work.
3. Small naps and breaks also refresh your mind thus helpful in boosting our contraction power.
4. Divide bigger tasks into meaningful smaller tasks.
5. Deep breathing and meditation are very effective to train one's mind alive and concentrated.

## goals are important

Last but not the least, I have observed that whenever I am having a clear goal in my life my mind adopted a higher concentration level. I will explore the importance of a clear goal in our lives in a separate chapter.

## meditation helps

Many people have asked me, which type of meditation or rituals one should practice to boost their concentration level. It is explained in the Bhagavadgita chapter 06 verse 12 and 13 that: "Seated firmly, the yogi should strive to purify the mind by focusing it in meditation with one-pointed concentration, controlling all thoughts and activities." -12 "He must hold the body, neck and head firmly in a straight line, and gaze at the tip of the nose without allowing the eyes to wander." -13

There are many types of other practices one can do to enhance their concentration level. What I found by my own experience is that 15 minutes practice of observing the breathing pattern consciously with closed eyes in any comfortable position is very useful in enhancing our concentration power. Moreover, if you practice consciously, doing any of your task of 2 to 5 minutes with full attention it will train your mind for doing other works with full attention too.
